This is good new just tested a very basic programa to see if one servo is enough to move the window and it is.
That is the good news the bad news is that now i need something to keep the servo in place and attactch to the window to move it.
could use lego and attach it to the servo and duct tape
What to find a way to attach the survo and the window by tommorow.
