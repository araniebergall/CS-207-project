This is good new just tested a very basic programa to see if one servo is enough to move the window and it is.
That is the good news the bad news is that now i need something to keep the servo in place and attactch to the window to move it.
could use lego and attach it to the servo and duct tape
What to find a way to attach the survo and the window by tommorow.

Turns out one sorvo can only move the window if there is no to high of resesntence then it struggles. Good news
The hevay duty mottor and mottor shield has arvived so more time can be addresed to how to get that window open

I have finally finsish the set up for the devices that holds the arduino, the servo. The code is finished as well but there is some problems that
have is first is the plastic part that is attach to the window has been shereded inside, the servo will freeze up and finally the window 
that is attach is partially frozen.
